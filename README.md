  ## Description

  This project allowed me to create an interface, particularly a Content Management System (CMS), that make it easy to view and interact with information stored in a database. This CLI allows a user to view, add, and update employee's, role's, and department's in a streamlined manner. I was able to build and design this system for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
